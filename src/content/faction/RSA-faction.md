The Rouge Sentinel Alliance was formed between sentinels who have broken free from the hive mind
and the travelers who helped with that process.
The RSA are experts in all Sentinel related things, be it technology, ships, multitools or even just the sentinels themselves.

Goals:
-Free sentinels from the hive mind ( via "Trace of metal" quest - requirement for joining)

Help Travellers with any sentinel related jobs

Document all Sentinel related subjects

Maintain order on planets by removing sentinel threats / other dangerous groups when requested by clients


The Lead Node Entity is @Lost\\Here  , if you want to apply just react to this with ":sentinel: "and they will either approve or deny your membership. 
This is up the the discretion of said leader. 
They then contact @Nolo or an Admin to grant the role. This will grant you access to an exclusive RSA communications network within this server.
