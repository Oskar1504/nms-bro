## Slogan
"Never lost! Always curious."

## Salutations:
"May your travels be long, and strange!" 
"Strange  travels"

## Purpose:
Explore every corner of the universe. Catalog and collect new discoveries. Make first contact with new civilizations. Provide knowledge to the Civilization of what lies beyond. Aide in the establishment of trading, mining and farming outposts in remote locations by providing info to respective factions.

## Who should join: 

Anyone who is a true wondering explorer, not interested in a rigid framework of rules on how to explore and where to explore. Those who are not interested in being mercenaries, because we would be peaceful envoys but will come to the defense of fellow members. Those who enjoy the lone wolf exploration but would like to also take advantage of exploring with others.
