# METAL CORP (Mechanic Extraction, Terraforming, Advancement and Logistics)

## ACTIVITY: Industrial / Mining

## WILL PROVIDE:
- Access to contract-based resource acquisition/transportation.
- Access to highly secure intergalactic delivery routes for all your transportational needs.
- Access to planetary probes and build-site scouting

## HOW IT WORKS:
You contact METAL with what you need and we tell you how long it will take to provide. The only requirement? You allow us unrestricted access to your system/planets. This helps us build our logistics network and acquisition/delivery channels; ultimately helping us to help you better & faster.
That's it, no hidden costs, no strings attached, anywhere in the Universe. We help you build out your projects by giving your more time to focus on the building and by having you worry less about resources.
