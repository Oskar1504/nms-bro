Description:
Through various tech deals and in the near past even contracts with the intergalactic military, Magistrada was able to get hold of the spearhead as a century-old family-run company. Magistrada spans multiple galaxies, with subsidiaries in Eissentam, Calypso, as well as funding a cyberpunk-like city in Euclid called "The Hive". 

Members of the corporation usually fly in black or gray interceptors, since this was the original model series from magistrada, but this is not a must. Magistrada not only extends from Interceptor to Solar Wings, but also builds a fleet of capital ships, the Dreadnaught Lunar Eclipse stands out and is regarded as the spearhead of the Magistrada exploration fleet. Current location of the Lunar Eclipse: Euclid Naboo

Tasks:
-Spacecraft Dealership, tank and repair stations
-VIP lounges for our corporate partners/guests as a resting place on long business trips
-Gathering point of different personalities

Who can participate?
-People who of course like to build, especially refuel and repair stations and VIP lounges (mostly dark cozy vibes)
-People who like to operate shiphunting
-Basically everyone who likes the game and is reflected here in the description

Our goals:

-Expand on refuel and repair stations in the galaxy and surrounding system.
-to offer customers (you) a purchase or exchange for spaceships of any kind
-Build VIP lounges for our customers who require special discretion (John wick: Continental)
