Headquartered on the Capital of Naboo, the RNSC acts as the primary Capitol defense force and welcoming committee. It’s duties include but are not limited to; providing mutual assistance when clearing sentinels, aiding newcomers to NMS, keeping track and aiding in the construction of structures on Naboo, cooperative expeditions, resource gathering, etc.

"When I first began playing a few months ago it was kind of overwhelming. I had to rely on YouTube tutorials for stuff and a lot of the information was difficult for me to understand. I’m not sure how many newcomers have this problem but I figure this faction would be a good thing to have so we can kinda help those who are newer or who might’ve come from YouTube and aren’t skilled in some areas or people who just wanna hang out and help the building factions build up the capital." - @Ranger Houston
